=head1 NAME

Cache::Memcached::Sweet - sugary memcached with callbacks 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Reads MEMCACHED_HOST from env, and defaults to localhost:11211 if not set

  use Cache::Memcached::Sweet; # exports the subroutine "memcached"

  my $value = memcached($key, sub { 
 	return some_expensive_operation($foo, $bar, $baz);
  });

  my $value = memcached($key); # retrieve value

  memcached($other_key, { a => 1, b => 2 }, 600); # set value with TTL


=head1 FUNCTIONS

L<Cache::Memcached::Sweet> implements and exports the following function

=head2 memcached
  
  # Set's a value with no TTL
  memcached('foo', $cache_this);

  # Sets a value, with optional ttl
  memcached('bar', { a => 1, b => 2 }, 600);

  # Retrieves a value from the cache
  my $value = memcached('baz');

  # Gets a value if it exists or sets it with the return value from executing the coderef
  # Note: The coderef is called in scalar context
  my $result = memcached('blurgh', sub { 
     buzz($blirp, $blurp) 
  });

  my $mc = memcached; # Exposes package global instance of Cache::Memcached
  $mc->set_servers()  # ... etc, but not recommended
  
=head1 CAUTION

This module is meant to provide convenience, and is hardcoded to get the memcached server address from MEMCACHED_HOST or will default to localhost:11211. If you're running some fancy memcached cluster, then this module is probably not for you.
